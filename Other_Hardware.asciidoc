Dual kernel configuration
-------------------------

This section provides information regarding which desktop/server
system is known to work with Xenomai 2, and Xenomai 3 over the
*Cobalt* core.

[NOTE]
In this configuration, a proper I-pipe patch has to be applied to the
target kernel, for interfacing Linux with the Xenomai
co-kernel. Xenomai 3 in a *dual kernel configuration only* requires a
Linux 3.10 kernel or later - this restriction does not apply to the
link:Embedded_Hardware#hardware_Single_Kernel[single-kernel
configuration]. Xenomai 2 can run in dual kernel configuration only,
with older kernels.

Supported Architectures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Xenomai was reported to work on Apple's PowerPC desktops/servers based
on the G4 (32bit architecture) and G5 (PowerPC 970 64bit architecture)
families.

SMP support
^^^^^^^^^^^

Xenomai is SMP-capable on PowerPC desktops/servers. However, SMP support
for ppc32 was officially made available in Xenomai v2.4.8. SMP/ppc64 was
already supported by earlier Xenomai releases though.

[[x86]]

~~~

Xenomai 2 supports all x86-compatible 32/64bit processor types
starting from i486 CPUs and better.

Xenomai 3 over the *Cobalt* core supports all x86-compatible 32/64bit
processor types starting from i586 CPUs with hardware TSC support and
better.

[NOTE]
Lowest latencies are achieved when a TSC and local APIC are available
from the CPU, which any modern x86 desktop/server has; just make sure
the processor type you pick in your kernel configuration actually
matches your CPU.  However, desktop/server x86 hardware may have
issues when running real-time software, depending on the kernel
configuration. In any case, make sure to read
link:Configuring_For_X86_Based_Dual_Kernels[this
document] prior to configuring your kernel.

Supported Sub-Architectures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Xenomai is known to work on all PC-compatible desktops/servers.

SMP support
^^^^^^^^^^^

Xenomai is SMP-capable on all supported multi-processor/multi-core x86
platforms.

Single kernel configuration
---------------------------

If you plan to run Xenomai 3 over the *Mercury* core, any Linux-based
platform with _glibc_ or _uClibc_ support will do. In this
configuration, Xenomai 3 can run on mainline kernels starting from the
kernel 2.6.x series onward. The availability of the
https://www.osadl.org/Realtime-Linux.projects-realtime-linux.0.html[PREEMPT-RT]
feature is optional, although recommended if getting short and bounded
response time is a requirement.
