Xenomai is a Free Software project in which engineers from a wide
background collaborate to build a versatile real-time framework for
the Linux(C) platform.

We are heading to the next generation Xenomai 4, while preserving the
user investment in Xenomai 3.x. To this end, the specification process
of a link:Common_Xenomai_Platform[Common Xenomai Platform] has
started, which shall define a set of common features and interfaces
all Xenomai releases starting from 3.3 would share.

## Interrupt pipeline (I-pipe)

The Cobalt real-time core depends on a patch to the mainline Linux
kernel, which introduces a separate, high-priority execution stage for
running out-of-band interrupt handlers immediately upon IRQ receipt,
which cannot be delayed by the regular kernel work.

Released patches can be downloaded from:
https://xenomai.org/downloads/ipipe[https://xenomai.org/downloads/ipipe].

The current development trees (starting from kernel 4.14) for the
I-pipe are available from:

* **ARM**:  https://xenomai.org/gitlab/ipipe-arm[https://xenomai.org/gitlab/ipipe-arm]
* **ARM64**: https://xenomai.org/gitlab/ipipe-arm64[https://xenomai.org/gitlab/ipipe-arm64]
* **PPC32**: https://xenomai.org/gitlab/ipipe-ppc32[https://xenomai.org/gitlab/ipipe-ppc32]
* **x86**: https://xenomai.org/gitlab/ipipe-x86[https://xenomai.org/gitlab/ipipe-x86]
