Xenomai is a Free Software project in which engineers from a wide
background collaborate to build a versatile real-time framework for
the Linux(C) platform.

The main project goal is to help migrating industrial applications
from proprietary real-time systems to Linux.

Xenomai is about making various real-time operating system APIs
available to Linux-based platforms. When the target Linux kernel
cannot meet the requirements with respect to response time
constraints, Xenomai can also supplement it for delivering stringent
real-time guarantees based on an original co-kernel technology.
