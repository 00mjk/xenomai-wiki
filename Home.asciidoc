Xenomai is a Free Software project in which engineers from a wide
background collaborate to build a robust and resource-efficient
real-time core for Linux(C) following the dual kernel approach, for
applications with stringent latency requirements.

* The current stable release is Xenomai **3.1**.

* Work is ongoing towards release **3.2**, including Y2038 readiness
  and a transition to a modern interrupt pipeline implementation
  called https://evlproject.org/dovetail/[Dovetail] which substitutes
  for the I-pipe, in order to support kernel 5.10 and beyond.

---
We are also paving the way to Xenomai 4, which is going to be based on
the next generation real-time core developed by the
https://evlproject.org/[EVL project], with the intent to preserve the
user investment in Xenomai 3.x. To this end, the specification process
of a link:Common_Xenomai_Platform[Common Xenomai Platform] has
started. By this process, we define a set of common features and
interfaces future Xenomai releases will share, starting from
Xenomai **3.3**.

## Interrupt pipeline (I-pipe)

The Cobalt real-time core depends on a patch to the mainline Linux
kernel, which introduces a separate, high-priority execution stage for
running out-of-band interrupt handlers immediately upon IRQ receipt,
which cannot be delayed by the regular kernel work.

Released patches can be downloaded from:
https://xenomai.org/downloads/ipipe[https://xenomai.org/downloads/ipipe].

The current development trees (starting from kernel 4.14) for the
I-pipe are available from:

* **ARM**:  https://xenomai.org/gitlab/ipipe-arm[https://xenomai.org/gitlab/ipipe-arm]
