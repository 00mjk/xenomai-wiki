Xenomai is a Free Software project in which engineers from a wide
background collaborate to build a versatile real-time framework for
the Linux(C) platform.

The main project goal is to help migrating industrial applications
from proprietary real-time systems to Linux.

Xenomai is about making various real-time operating system APIs
available to Linux-based platforms. When the target Linux kernel
cannot meet the requirements with respect to response time
constraints, Xenomai can also supplement it for delivering stringent
real-time guarantees based on an original dual kernel approach.

## Interrupt pipeline (I-pipe)

The Cobalt real-time core depends on a patch to the mainline Linux
kernel, which introduces a separate, high-priority execution stage for
running out-of-band interrupt handlers immediately upon IRQ receipt,
which cannot be delayed by the regular kernel work.

Released patches can be downloaded from:
https://xenomai.org/downloads/ipipe[https://xenomai.org/downloads/ipipe].

The current development trees (starting from kernel 4.14) for the
I-pipe are available from:

* **ARM**:  https://xenomai.org/gitlab/ipipe-arm[https://xenomai.org/gitlab/ipipe-arm]
* **ARM64**: https://xenomai.org/gitlab/ipipe-arm64[https://xenomai.org/gitlab/ipipe-arm64]
* **PPC32**: https://xenomai.org/gitlab/ipipe-ppc32[https://xenomai.org/gitlab/ipipe-ppc32]
* **x86**: https://xenomai.org/gitlab/ipipe-x86[https://xenomai.org/gitlab/ipipe-x86]
