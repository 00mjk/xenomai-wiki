[[overview]]
Overview
--------

http://www.rtnet.org[RTnet] has been designed to lend real-time
networking functionality to both the RTAI and Xenomai
environments. This document seeks to serve as a springboard for the
beginner into RTnet with Xenomai.  The following links gives more
information regarding various aspects of the installation and
programming of RTnet in the Xenomai environment.

The code of the RTnet project is organized in a modular way. The usual
big picture is a TDMA realtime fieldbus, but you can also use RTnet
for much simpler tasks, such as realtime point-to-point
communication.

For simpler tasks, you may not need all of RTnet. These help

[[rtnet-structure]]
RTnet Structure
---------------

After the installation of RTnet there should be two folders of interest
regarding RTnet.

[[source-folder]]
Source Folder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first is the RTnet source where the RTnet source code is located.
Its default location is at _/usr/src/rtnet-x.y.zÂ .

This folder will in future be referenced to as **. In this folder the
raw RTnet code is located. The sub folders of interest to the normal
programmer is the *Documentation/* and *examples/* folders. The
*Documentation/* folder contains basic information regarding the
structure and used of functionalities in RTnet. On the other hand the
*examples/* folder contains the source code of the examples that has
been compiled and placed in the */examples* folder.

[[installation-folder-overview]]
Installation Folder Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The second folder of interest is the folder where RTnet was installed
into. The default location for this would be _/usr/local/rtnet_.

This folder will be referred to in the future as **. The installation
folder contains all of the compiled executables and kernel modules
needed to run RTnet. The sub folders in ** are discussed next.

. etc: The two setup configuration files for RTnet are located in this
folder.  +rtnet.conf+ and +tdma.conf+ settings are both discussed in
this link:Rtnet_Configuration_File[document].

. examples: The compiled RTnet examples are placed here.

. sbin: In this folder there are various scripts that are used to run
and configure RTnet.

. include: This is the folder that contains the include files that
will be used in compliling any RTnet programs.

. modules: The compiled modules for RTnet and all of the components to
make it run efficiently along with the real-time device drivers, are
located here.
