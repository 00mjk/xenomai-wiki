Gilles Chanteperdrix has massively contributed to the Xenomai project from
the very beginning of this effort, he left us on Sunday 7th August
2016. He will forever be remembered as a true-hearted man, a brilliant
mind always scratching beneath the surface, looking for elegance in
the driest topics, never jaded from such accomplishment.

In addition to his critical contributions which shaped the real-time
Linux co-kernel technology used in many real-world applications today,
his willingness to help users has always been a distinctive aspect of
his personality.

He will be sorely missed.
