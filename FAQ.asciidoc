On what hardware does Xenomai run?
----------------------------------

Embedded hardware, desktop, server. This said, Xenomai has a strong
focus on embedded systems, and most Xenomai ports nowadays target
those platforms.

See the link:Embedded_Hardware[embedded hardware list], and the
link:Other_Hardware[other-hardware list].

Is my embedded setup supported by Xenomai?
------------------------------------------

See the link:Embedded_Hardware[embedded hardware list].

If your board is not listed above, you may want to get more information
from the mailto:xenomai@xenomai.org[Xenomai mailing list].

If you are willing to port Xenomai to an ARM-based system, you may
want to have a look at
link:Porting_Xenomai_To_A_New_Arm_Soc[this document].

What is this I-pipe thing? And what about Adeos? Are they related?
------------------------------------------------------------------

In Xenomai parlance, the I-pipe and Adeos both refer to the very same
code, that makes a Linux kernel able to host a secondary kernel
exhibiting real-time properties (e.g. Xenomai), on the same hardware.

This code is a kernel patch applied to a regular Linux kernel, which
among other services, guarantees delivery of external interrupts to
Xenomai with very low latency.

[NOTE]
You need the I-Pipe only for running Xenomai in a dual kernel
configuration, i.e. over the Cobalt core.

Which I-pipe patch should I use with Xenomai version X on platform Y?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Check link:/downloads/ipipe/[there] for an I-pipe patch which best
fits your kernel.

What is a Xenomai _skin_?
-------------------------

To understand that, you should first know that Xenomai is some sort of
http://www.xenomai.org/documentation/slides/Xenomai-OSMB-2007-01.pdf[Chameleon
RTOS] at its core, which can export multiple real-time APIs to
applications, all built over the Xenomai _nucleus_.

A Xenomai API can impersonate an existing traditional RTOS interface
such as VxWorks (tm), or provide an original programming interface for
some particular purpose, such as
http://www.xenomai.org/documentation/branches/v2.4.x/html/api/group__rtdm.html[RTDM].

Basically, each API makes Xenomai look a different RTOS albeit all of
them are based on the same common core. This is the reason why we call
an implementation of such API, a Xenomai _skin_.

Can I still use GDB in a dual kernel configuration?
---------------------------------------------------

Yes, definitely. Debugging a Xenomai application in a dual kernel
system is no different from debugging any regular application.

[NOTE]
The only side-effect of using GDB for debugging a Xenomai application
is that breakpointing and single-stepping implies a switch to
secondary mode (i.e. threads are automatically handed over the Linux
kernel as soon as GDB regains control).

How to compile a RTDM-based driver?
-----------------------------------

See link:Building_Applications_For_Xenomai_3_X#compiling_a_rtdm_Based_module[there].

Running scripts/bootstrap complains about LT_SYS_SYMBOL_USCORE
--------------------------------------------------------------

e.g.:
..........................
$ cd xenomai-3
$ ./scripts/bootstrap
...
configure.ac:93: error: possibly undefined macro: LT_SYS_SYMBOL_USCORE
      If this token and others are legitimate, please use m4_pattern_allow.
      See the Autoconf documentation.
autoreconf: /usr/bin/autoconf failed with exit status: 1
..........................

On Debian-based systems like Ubuntu, you need to install the
libltdl-dev package for building Xenomai from sources.

Can I mirror Xenomai git repositories ?
---------------------------------------

Yes. However, we recommend using
link://github.com/mricon/grokmirror[grokmirror]. For more details, see
link:/mirroring-xenomai-git-repositories-with-grokmirror[the
following page].

I ran into a technical issue which is not covered here
